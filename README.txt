This is a Directory Bruteforcer for the Carnegie Directory, located here:

http://directory.andrew.cmu.edu/search/basic

Why did I write this? Mostly because I'm bored. I figured it would be fun to mess around with some Carnegie stuff, because I know that no matter how skilled I may be at programming or things like that, my grades will never get me in there.

Anyhow, enjoy!

Currently non-functioning, but when working it's going to bruteforce search strings to find usernames of everyone listed in the directory. It uses a three-letter search plus a wildcard so that the searches are specific enough to *hopefully* not hit the results-cap (200 people) while still returning results. (Right now joh* hits the results cap, because of all of the people with John names and such. I believe that when incorperated with all of the other strings that will be searched, though, you actually get all of the people past the 200)
